# Xinhao (Tayler) Li data visualization works

This repository contains the previous data visualization works completed by Tayler.

The folder `BST260_assignments` contains two data visualization projects completed for the course BST 260: Introduction to Data Science. The first one is a homework assignment where the effect of vaccine and the spread rate of measles and the validity of the rumor that vaccines are related to autism are investigated using a combination of line plots, histograms, box plots and tile plots. The second one is a Shiny App as part of the final project. In this Shiny App, the relationship between the price of Boston Airbnb listings and each and every host-, property-, policies- and location-related variable is explored using box plots (for categorical predictors), scatter plots (for continuous variables), and maps. The Shiny App is published and can be found following this URL https://tayler99-bucharest.shinyapps.io/airbnb/.

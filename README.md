# Xinhao (Tayler) Li data visualization works

This repository contains the previous data visualization works completed by Tayler.

The folder `BST260_assignments` contains two R-based data visualization projects completed for the course BST 260: Introduction to Data Science. `ggplot` is used for data visualization. The first project is a homework assignment where the effect of vaccine and the spread rate of measles and the validity of the rumor that vaccines are related to autism are investigated using a combination of line plots, histograms, box plots and tile plots. The second project is a Shiny App as part of the final project. In this Shiny App, the relationship between the price of Boston Airbnb listings and each and every host-, property-, policies- and location-related variable is explored using box plots (for categorical predictors), scatter plots (for continuous variables), and maps. The Shiny App is published and can be found following this URL https://tayler99-bucharest.shinyapps.io/airbnb/.

The folder `CS181_assignment` contains one python-based data visualization project completed for the course CS 181: Machine Learning. `matplotlib` is used for data visualization. This project is part of a homework. In this project, logistic regression model and k-nearest neighbors models are fitted to a training dataset `hr.csv`, and these models are used to predict the class of test data points. The decision boundaries yielded by different models is then visualized.
